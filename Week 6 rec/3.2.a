Problem 3.2.a. Write out the steps you would use to solve this problem by hand as pseudocode. Stating
your modifications to your validateInt is also sufficient.

main: 
1. display prompt for input and allow user to input a string
2. call my function (return is a bool)
3. display it is valid if the function return is true, display not valid if the return is false

my function:
1. take in a string and output a boolean
2. turn the string into a double
    revision: check for errors when turning the string into the double. return false if you get an error. 
3. turn that double back into a string so it can be compared with the original string
    revision: remove trailing 0s that result from turning a double into a string
4. compare the original string and the new string. return true if they are the same.
